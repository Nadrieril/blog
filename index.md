### 🔭 About Me
- I'm a Research Engineer at Inria Paris (France), working on [Charon](https://github.com/AeneasVerif/charon).
- I'm a contributor to the Rust project and member of the compiler and lang-advisor teams.
    - I specialize in features related to pattern-matching.
- I intend this blog to be where I publish notes I've made about the design or semantics of Rust
    - You may find some such notes in my [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@Nadrieril) or
      [gists](https://gist.github.com/Nadrieril) already; I may turn some of these into posts.
